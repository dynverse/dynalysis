  Using single-cell transcriptomics data, it is now possible to computationally order cells along trajectories, allowing the unbiased transcriptome-wide study of cell differentiation. Dozens of trajectory inference methods have been developed, early methods mostly focussing on linear trajectories, while recently methods also model more complex branching trajectories. However, the performance of these methods have not yet been comprehensively evaluated. Here we compare a total of 22 trajectory inference methods, on both realistic synthetic datasets and a large set is real datasets. We employ a novel parameter optimisation procedure, and compare methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred ordering, correctness of the network wiring, code quality and user friendliness. We conclude with practical guidelines for method users, as well as future . Our whole evaluation pipeline is fully reproducible and available at www.github.com/dynverse.

## Evaluation workflow
Overview of methods...
Overview of parameter optimalisation...
Nicely illustrated using the toy datasets: Simpele toy datasets. Theoretische mogelijkheden van elke methode + bewijs van waarde van parameteroptimalisatie

*Points to maybe raise*:
- Some methods can handle different trajectories which are not directly described in the main paper: eg. circular trajectories (for a lot of principal curves algorithms using `periodic.lowess`), trees (for a lot of bifurcation methods)

## Evaluation on synthetic data
Initial evaluation..
Robustness..
Gegenereerde synthetische data. Parameter tuning voor echte data + initiÃ«le evaluatie (tot wat is de methode in staat) + robustness etc testing

## Evaluation on real data
Biological relevance..
Echte data. Evaluatie (biologische relevantie van de methode)
