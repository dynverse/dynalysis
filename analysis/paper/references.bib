  abstract = {Recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics have opened new opportunities for studying dynamic processes in immunology in a high throughput and unbiased manner. Starting from a mixture of cells in different stages of a developmental process, unsupervised trajectory inference algorithms aim to automatically reconstruct the underlying developmental path that cells are following. In this review, we break down the strategies used by this novel class of methods, and organize their components into a common framework, highlighting several practical advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods. We also give an overview of new insights these methods have already provided regarding the wiring and gene regulation of cell differentiation. As the trajectory inference field is still in its infancy, we propose several future developments that will ultimately lead to a global and data-driven way of studying immune cell differentiation.},

We characterize performance, data requirements, and inherent biases of different inference approaches offering guidelines for both algorithm application and development. We observe that no single inference method performs optimally across all datasets. In contrast, integration of predictions from multiple inference methods shows robust and high performance across diverse datasets. Thereby, we construct high-confidence networks for E. coli and S. aureus, each comprising \textasciitilde{}1700 transcriptional interactions at an estimated precision of 50\%. We experimentally test 53 novel interactions in E. coli, of which 23 were supported (43\%).

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq allows quantification of biological heterogeneity across both discrete cell types and continuous cell differentiation transitions. We present approximate graph abstraction (AGA), an algorithm that reconciles the computational analysis strategies of clustering and trajectory inference by explaining cell-to-cell variation both in terms of discrete and continuous latent variables (https://github.com/theislab/graph\_abstraction). This enables to generate cellular maps of differentiation manifolds with complex topologies --- efficiently and robustly across different datasets. Approximate graph abstraction quantifies the connectivity of partitions of a neighborhood graph of single cells, thereby generating a much simpler abstracted graph whose nodes label the partitions. Together with a random walk-based distance measure, this generates a topology preserving map of single cells --- a partial coordinatization of data useful for exploring and explaining its variation. We use the abstracted graph to assess which subsets of data are better explained by discrete clusters than by a continuous variable, to trace gene expression changes along aggregated single-cell paths through data and to infer abstracted trees that best explain the global topology of data. We demonstrate the power of the method by reconstructing differentiation processes with high numbers of branchings from single-cell gene expression datasets and by identifying biological trajectories from single-cell imaging data using a deep-learning based distance metric. Along with the method, we introduce measures for the connectivity of graph partitions, generalize random-walk based distance measures to disconnected graphs and introduce a path-based measure for topological similarity between graphs. Graph abstraction is computationally efficient and provides speedups of at least 30 times when compared to algorithms for the inference of lineage trees.},

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Over the last decade, numerous methods have been developed for inference of regulatory networks from gene expression data. However, accurate and systematic evaluation of these methods is hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate benchmarks and the lack of tools for a differentiated analysis of network predictions on such benchmarks.
RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel and comprehensive method for in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network inference methods available to the community as an open-source software called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). In addition to the generation of detailed dynamical models of gene regulatory networks to be used as benchmarks, GNW provides a network motif analysis that reveals systematic prediction errors, thereby indicating potential ways of improving inference methods. The accuracy of network inference methods is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision-recall and receiver operating characteristic curves. We show how GNW can be used to assess the performance and identify the strengths and weaknesses of six inference methods. Furthermore, we used GNW to provide the international Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) competition with three network inference challenges (DREAM3, DREAM4 and DREAM5).
AVAILABILITY: GNW is available at http://gnw.sourceforge.net along with its Java source code, user manual and supporting data.

Here we identified a double-negative feedback loop between the transcription factors IRF4 and IRF8 that regulated the initial developmental bifurcation of activated B cells as well as the GC response. IRF8 dampened signaling via the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), facilitated antigen-specific interaction with helper T cells, and promoted antibody affinity maturation while antagonizing IRF4-driven differentiation of plasmablasts. Genomic analysis revealed concentration-dependent actions of IRF4 and IRF8 in regulating distinct gene-expression programs. Stochastic modeling suggested that the double-negative feedback was sufficient to initiate bifurcation of the B cell developmental trajectories.},

The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

  abstract = {Though it is important for the success of multicellular organisms that their many different cell types remain stable once specified, advances in the production of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from somatic cells by exposure to a transcription factor cocktail emphasize the potential of almost any cell to be reprogrammed. This raises the question of whether interconversion between cell types occurs physiologically or in the context of disease. Thomas Graf and Tariq Enver use examples from the blood cell system to illustrate the principles of transcription factor transdifferentiation, which they conclude is a process fundamentally similar to differentiation and different from iPS reprogramming. They postulate that conversions of one cell type to another can occur as a normal developmental process, and speculate on the prospects of forced lineage reprogramming in regenerative medicine.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Waddington's epigenetic landscape is probably the most famous and most powerful metaphor in developmental biology. Cells, represented by balls, roll downhill through a landscape of bifurcating valleys. Each new valley represents a possible cell fate and the ridges between the valleys maintain the cell fate once it has been chosen. Here I examine models of two important developmental processes \textemdash{} cell-fate induction and lateral inhibition \textemdash{} and ask whether the landscapes for these models at least qualitatively resemble Waddington's picture. For cell-fate induction, the answer is no. The commitment of a cell to a new fate corresponds to the disappearance of a valley from the landscape, not the splitting of one valley into two, and it occurs through a type of bifurcation \textemdash{} a saddle-node bifurcation \textemdash{} that possesses an intrinsic irreversibility that is missing from Waddington's picture. Lateral inhibition, a symmetrical cell\textendash{}cell competition process, corresponds better to Waddington's picture, with one valley reversibly splitting into two through a pitchfork bifurcation. I propose an alternative epigenetic landscape that has numerous valleys and ridges right from the start, with the process of cell-fate commitment corresponding to the irreversible disappearance of some of these valleys and ridges, via cell-fate induction, complemented by the creation of new valleys and ridges through processes like cell\textendash{}cell competition.},

  abstract = {Despite their importance, the molecular circuits that control the differentiation of na{\"\i}ve T cells remain largely unknown. Recent studies that reconstructed regulatory networks in mammalian cells have focused on short-term responses and relied on perturbation-based approaches that cannot be readily applied to primary T cells. Here, we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution, novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based tools for performing perturbations in primary T cells to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic regulatory network that controls Th17 differentiation. The network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, whose coupled action may be essential for maintaining the balance between Th17 and other CD4+ T cell subsets. Overall, our study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and reveals its organizational principles, and highlights novel drug targets for controlling Th17 differentiation.},

  abstract = {Most bioinformatics tools available today were not written by professional software developers, but by people that wanted to solve their own problems, using computational solutions and spending the minimum time and effort possible, since these were just the means to an end. Consequently, a vast number of software applications are currently available, hindering the task of identifying the utility and quality of each. At the same time, this situation has hindered regular adoption of these tools in clinical practice. Typically, they are not sufficiently developed to be used by most clinical researchers and practitioners. To address these issues, it is necessary to re-think how biomedical applications are built and adopt new strategies that ensure quality, efficiency, robustness, correctness and reusability of software components. We also need to engage end-users during the development process to ensure that applications fit their needs. In this review, we present a set of guidelines to support biomedical software development, with an explanation of how they can be implemented and what kind of open-source tools can be used for each specific topic.},
