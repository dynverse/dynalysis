  abstract = {Recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics have opened new opportunities for studying dynamic processes in immunology in a high throughput and unbiased manner. Starting from a mixture of cells in different stages of a developmental process, unsupervised trajectory inference algorithms aim to automatically reconstruct the underlying developmental path that cells are following. In this review, we break down the strategies used by this novel class of methods, and organize their components into a common framework, highlighting several practical advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods. We also give an overview of new insights these methods have already provided regarding the wiring and gene regulation of cell differentiation. As the trajectory inference field is still in its infancy, we propose several future developments that will ultimately lead to a global and data-driven way of studying immune cell differentiation.},

We characterize performance, data requirements, and inherent biases of different inference approaches offering guidelines for both algorithm application and development. We observe that no single inference method performs optimally across all datasets. In contrast, integration of predictions from multiple inference methods shows robust and high performance across diverse datasets. Thereby, we construct high-confidence networks for E. coli and S. aureus, each comprising \textasciitilde{}1700 transcriptional interactions at an estimated precision of 50\%. We experimentally test 53 novel interactions in E. coli, of which 23 were supported (43\%).

As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Over the last decade, numerous methods have been developed for inference of regulatory networks from gene expression data. However, accurate and systematic evaluation of these methods is hampered by the difficulty of constructing adequate benchmarks and the lack of tools for a differentiated analysis of network predictions on such benchmarks.
RESULTS: Here, we describe a novel and comprehensive method for in silico benchmark generation and performance profiling of network inference methods available to the community as an open-source software called GeneNetWeaver (GNW). In addition to the generation of detailed dynamical models of gene regulatory networks to be used as benchmarks, GNW provides a network motif analysis that reveals systematic prediction errors, thereby indicating potential ways of improving inference methods. The accuracy of network inference methods is evaluated using standard metrics such as precision-recall and receiver operating characteristic curves. We show how GNW can be used to assess the performance and identify the strengths and weaknesses of six inference methods. Furthermore, we used GNW to provide the international Dialogue for Reverse Engineering Assessments and Methods (DREAM) competition with three network inference challenges (DREAM3, DREAM4 and DREAM5).
AVAILABILITY: GNW is available at http://gnw.sourceforge.net along with its Java source code, user manual and supporting data.

IRF8 dampened signaling via the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), facilitated antigen-specific interaction with helper T cells, and promoted antibody affinity maturation while antagonizing IRF4-driven differentiation of plasmablasts. Genomic analysis revealed concentration-dependent actions of IRF4 and IRF8 in regulating distinct gene-expression programs. Stochastic modeling suggested that the double-negative feedback was sufficient to initiate bifurcation of the B cell developmental trajectories.},

The cells can have states with the higher probability ones giving the different cell types. Different cell types correspond to different basins of attractions of the probability landscape. We study how the cells develop from undifferentiated cells to differentiated cells from landscape perspectives. We quantified the Waddington landscape through construction of underlying probability landscape for cell development. We show the developmental process proceeds as moving from undifferentiated to the differentiated basins of attractions. The barrier height of the basins of attractions correlates with the escape time that determines the stability of cell types. We show that the developmental process can be quantitatively described and uncovered by the biological paths on the quantified Waddington landscape from undifferentiated to the differentiated cells. We found the dynamics of the developmental process is controlled by a combination of the gradient and curl force on the landscape. The biological paths often do not follow the steepest descent path on the landscape. The landscape framework also quantifies the possibility of reverse differentiation process such as cell reprogramming from differentiated cells back to the original stem cell. We show that the biological path of reverse differentiation is irreversible and different from the one for differentiation process. We found that the developmental process described by the underlying landscape and the associated biological paths is relatively stable and robust against the influences of environmental perturbations.},

Thomas Graf and Tariq Enver use examples from the blood cell system to illustrate the principles of transcription factor transdifferentiation, which they conclude is a process fundamentally similar to differentiation and different from iPS reprogramming.

Cells, represented by balls, roll downhill through a landscape of bifurcating valleys. Each new valley represents a possible cell fate and the ridges between the valleys maintain the cell fate once it has been chosen. Here I examine models of two important developmental processes \textemdash{} cell-fate induction and lateral inhibition \textemdash{} and ask whether the landscapes for these models at least qualitatively resemble Waddington's picture. For cell-fate induction, the answer is no. The commitment of a cell to a new fate corresponds to the disappearance of a valley from the landscape, not the splitting of one valley into two, and it occurs through a type of bifurcation \textemdash{} a saddle-node bifurcation \textemdash{} that possesses an intrinsic irreversibility that is missing from Waddington's picture. Lateral inhibition, a symmetrical cell\textendash{}cell competition process, corresponds better to Waddington's picture, with one valley reversibly splitting into two through a pitchfork bifurcation. I propose an alternative epigenetic landscape that has numerous valleys and ridges right from the start, with the process of cell-fate commitment corresponding to the irreversible disappearance of some of these valleys and ridges, via cell-fate induction, complemented by the creation of new valleys and ridges through processes like cell\textendash{}cell competition.},

Here, we combine transcriptional profiling at high temporal resolution, novel computational algorithms, and innovative nanowire-based tools for performing perturbations in primary T cells to systematically derive and experimentally validate a model of the dynamic regulatory network that controls Th17 differentiation. The network consists of two self-reinforcing, but mutually antagonistic, modules, with 12 novel regulators, whose coupled action may be essential for maintaining the balance between Th17 and other CD4+ T cell subsets. Overall, our study identifies and validates 39 regulatory factors, embeds them within a comprehensive temporal network and reveals its organizational principles, and highlights novel drug targets for controlling Th17 differentiation.},

Consequently, a vast number of software applications are currently available, hindering the task of identifying the utility and quality of each. At the same time, this situation has hindered regular adoption of these tools in clinical practice. Typically, they are not sufficiently developed to be used by most clinical researchers and practitioners. To address these issues, it is necessary to re-think how biomedical applications are built and adopt new strategies that ensure quality, efficiency, robustness, correctness and reusability of software components. We also need to engage end-users during the development process to ensure that applications fit their needs. In this review, we present a set of guidelines to support biomedical software development, with an explanation of how they can be implemented and what kind of open-source tools can be used for each specific topic.},

  abstract = {Summary
Objective
The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of a real-time (``open-end'') version of the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for the recognition of motor exercises. Given a possibly incomplete input stream of data and a reference time series, the open-end DTW algorithm computes both the size of the prefix of reference which is best matched by the input, and the dissimilarity between the matched portions. The algorithm was used to provide real-time feedback to neurological patients undergoing motor rehabilitation.
Methods and materials
We acquired a dataset of multivariate time series from a sensorized long-sleeve shirt which contains 29 strain sensors distributed on the upper limb. Seven typical rehabilitation exercises were recorded in several variations, both correctly and incorrectly executed, and at various speeds, totaling a data set of 840 time series. Nearest-neighbour classifiers were built according to the outputs of open-end DTW alignments and their global counterparts on exercise pairs. The classifiers were also tested on well-known public datasets from heterogeneous domains.
Results
Nonparametric tests show that (1) on full time series the two algorithms achieve the same classification accuracy (p-value =0.32); (2) on partial time series, classifiers based on open-end DTW have a far higher accuracy ($\kappa$=0.898 versus $\kappa$=0.447;p$<$10-5); and (3) the prediction of the matched fraction follows closely the ground truth (root mean square $<$10\%). The results hold for the motor rehabilitation and the other datasets tested, as well.
Conclusions
The open-end variant of the DTW algorithm is suitable for the classification of truncated quantitative time series, even in the presence of noise. Early recognition and accurate class prediction can be achieved, provided that enough variance is available over the time span of the reference. Therefore, the proposed technique expands the use of DTW to a wider range of applications, such as real-time biofeedback systems.},

Especially the Earth Mover's Distance is used in a plethora of applications ranging from content-based image retrieval, shape matching, fingerprint recognition, object tracking and phishing web page detection to computing color differences in linguistics and biology. Our starting point is the well-known revised simplex algorithm, which iteratively improves a feasible solution to optimality. The Shortlist Method that we propose substantially reduces the number of candidates inspected for improving the solution, while at the same time balancing the number of pivots required. Tests on simulated benchmarks demonstrate a considerable reduction in computation time for the new method as compared to the usual revised simplex algorithm implemented with state-of-the-art initialization and pivot strategies. As a consequence, the Shortlist Method facilitates the computation of large scale transportation problems in viable time. In addition we describe a novel method for finding an initial feasible solution which we coin Modified Russell's Method.},

Here we describe Monocle, an unsupervised algorithm that increases the temporal resolution of transcriptome dynamics using single-cell RNA-Seq data collected at multiple time points. Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

SCUBA draws techniques from nonlinear dynamics and stochastic differential equation theories, providing a systematic framework for modeling complex processes involving multilineage specifications. By applying SCUBA to analyze two complementary, publicly available datasets we successfully reconstructed the cellular hierarchy during early development of mouse embryos, modeled the dynamic changes in gene expression patterns, and predicted the effects of perturbing key transcriptional regulators on inducing lineage biases. The results were robust with respect to experimental platform differences between RT-PCR and RNA sequencing. We selectively tested our predictions in Nanog mutants and found good agreement between SCUBA predictions and the experimental data. We further extended the utility of SCUBA by developing a method to reconstruct missing temporal-order information from a typical single-cell dataset. Analysis of a hematopoietic dataset suggests that our method is effective for reconstructing gene expression dynamics during human B-cell development. In summary, SCUBA provides a useful single-cell data analysis tool that is well-suited for the investigation of developmental processes.},

Using 30-channel mass cytometry data, we show that Wishbone accurately recovers the known stages of T-cell development in the mouse thymus, including the bifurcation point. We also apply the algorithm to mouse myeloid differentiation and demonstrate its generalization to additional lineages. A comparison of Wishbone to diffusion maps, SCUBA and Monocle shows that it outperforms these methods both in the accuracy of ordering cells and in the correct identification of branch points.},

Adult mitotic tissues like the intestine, skin, and blood undergo constant turnover throughout the life of an organism. Knowing the identity of the stem cell is crucial to understanding tissue homeostasis and its aberrations upon disease. Here we present a computational method for the derivation of a lineage tree from single-cell transcriptome data. By exploiting the tree topology and the transcriptome composition, we establish StemID, an algorithm for identifying stem cells among all detectable cell types within a population. We demonstrate that StemID recovers two known adult stem cell populations, Lgr5+ cells in the small intestine and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. We apply StemID to predict candidate multipotent cell populations in the human pancreas, a tissue with largely uncharacterized turnover dynamics. We hope that StemID will accelerate the search for novel stem cells by providing concrete markers for biological follow-up and validation.},

Currently, a limited number of computational tools are available for this task, and quantitative methods for comparing different tools are lacking. Tools for Single Cell Analysis (TSCAN) is a software tool developed to better support in silico pseudo-Time reconstruction in Single-Cell RNA-seq ANalysis. TSCAN uses a cluster-based minimum spanning tree (MST) approach to order cells. Cells are first grouped into clusters and an MST is then constructed to connect cluster centers. Pseudo-time is obtained by projecting each cell onto the tree, and the ordered sequence of cells can be used to study dynamic changes of gene expression along the pseudo-time. Clustering cells before MST construction reduces the complexity of the tree space. This often leads to improved cell ordering. It also allows users to conveniently adjust the ordering based on prior knowledge. TSCAN has a graphical user interface (GUI) to support data visualization and user interaction. Furthermore, quantitative measures are developed to objectively evaluate and compare different pseudo-time reconstruction methods. TSCAN is available at https://github.com/zji90/TSCAN and as a Bioconductor package.},

  abstract = {Fork in the road for immune cells
Immune cell differentiation along T helper pathways can profoundly influence the nature of the immune response\textemdash{}from promoting allergy to enhancing inflammation. L{\"o}nnberg et al. use single-cell transcriptomics and computational modeling to delineate the molecular cues that guide this decision. During blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice, the authors track TH1/TFH bifurcation at both the population and single-clone levels and identify genes associated with each path. They demonstrate roles of particular cell types in shaping this decision. This approach provides a broad framework for modeling immune cell differentiation in vivo.
Differentiation of na{\"\i}ve CD4+ T cells into functionally distinct T helper (TH) subsets is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Because of extensive heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and computational analysis with a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model, termed GPfates, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of TH1 and TFH (T follicular helper) cells during blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality using endogenous T cell receptor sequences, we first demonstrated that TH1/TFH bifurcation had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression was associated with TH1 or TFH fates and demonstrated a T cell\textendash{}intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting TH1 differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular relationship between TH1 and interleukin-10\textendash{}producing Tr1 cells in this infection. TH1 and TFH fates emerged from a highly proliferative precursor that up-regulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell interaction in driving TH1/TFH fates. In particular, we found that precursor TH cells were coached toward a TH1 but not a TFH fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two unique resources: a database, www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors controlling TH1/TFH fate commitment, and, more generally, GPfates, a modeling framework for characterizing cell differentiation toward multiple fates.
Computational modeling defines T helper cell differentiation toward multiple fates during experimental malaria.

Applied to mouse conventional dendritic cell (cDC) progenitors, Mpath constructs multi-branching trajectories spanning from macrophage/DC progenitors through common DC progenitor to pre-dendritic cells (preDC). The Mpath-generated trajectories detect a branching event at the preDC stage revealing preDC subsets that are exclusively committed to cDC1 or cDC2 lineages. Reordering cells along cDC development reveals sequential waves of gene regulation and temporal coupling between cell cycle and cDC differentiation. Applied to human myoblasts, Mpath recapitulates the time course of myoblast differentiation and isolates a branch of non-muscle cells involved in the differentiation. Our study shows that Mpath is a useful tool for constructing cell lineages from single-cell data.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Understanding the ``cellular programming'' that controls fundamental, dynamic biological processes is important for determining normal cellular function and potential perturbations that might give rise to physiological disorders. Ideally, investigations would employ time series experiments to periodically measure the properties of each cell. This would allow us to understand the sequence of gene (in)activations that constitute the program being followed. In practice, such experiments can be difficult to perform as cellular activity may be asynchronous with each cell occupying a different phase of the process of interested. Furthermore, the unbiased measurement of all transcripts or proteins requires the cells to be captured and lysed precluding the continued monitoring of that cell. In the absence of the ability to conduct true time series experiments, pseudotime algorithms exploit the asynchronous cellular nature of these systems to mathematically assign a ``pseudotime'' to each cell based on its molecular profile allowing the cells to be aligned and the sequence of gene activation events retrospectively inferred. Existing approaches predominantly use deterministic methods that ignore the statistical uncertainties associated with the problem. This paper demonstrates that this statistical uncertainty limits the temporal resolution that can be extracted from static snapshots of cell expression profiles and can also detrimentally affect downstream analysis.},

  abstract = {Pseudotime estimation from single-cell gene expression allows the recovery of temporal information from otherwise static profiles of individual cells. This pseudotemporal information can be used to characterise transient events in temporally evolving biological systems. Conventional algorithms typically emphasise an unsupervised transcriptome-wide approach and use retrospective analysis to evaluate the behaviour of individual genes. Here we introduce an orthogonal approach termed "Ouija" that learns pseudotimes from a small set of marker genes that might ordinarily be used to retrospectively confirm the accuracy of unsupervised pseudotime algorithms. Crucially, we model these genes in terms of switch-like or transient behaviour along the trajectory, allowing us to understand why the pseudotimes have been inferred and learn informative parameters about the behaviour of each gene. Since each gene is associated with a switch or peak time the genes are effectively ordered along with the cells, allowing each part of the trajectory to be understood in terms of the behaviour of certain genes. In the following we introduce our model and demonstrate that in many instances a small panel of marker genes can recover pseudotimes that are consistent with those obtained using the entire transcriptome. Furthermore, we show that our method can detect differences in the regulation timings between two genes and identify "metastable" states - discrete cell types along the continuous trajectories - that recapitulate known cell types. Ouija therefore provides a powerful complimentary approach to existing whole transcriptome based pseudotime estimation methods.

Computational techniques have arisen from areas such as single-cell 'omics and in cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However, methods to date typically assume homogenous genetic and environmental backgrounds, which becomes particularly limiting as datasets grow in size and complexity. As a solution to this we describe a novel statistical framework that learns pseudotime trajectories in the presence of non-homogeneous genetic, phenotypic, or environmental backgrounds. We demonstrate that this enables us to identify interactions between such factors and the underlying genomic trajectory. By applying this model to both single-cell gene expression data and population level cancer studies we show that it uncovers known and novel interaction effects between genetic and enironmental factors and the expression of genes in pathways.

Tissue regeneration is an orchestrated progression of cells from an immature state to a mature one, conventionally represented as distinctive cell subsets. A continuum of transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages. We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that accurately predicts the developmental path de novo. Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells. This trajectory revealed nascent fractions of B cell progenitors and aligned them with developmentally cued regulatory signaling including IL-7/STAT5 and cellular events such as immunoglobulin rearrangement, highlighting checkpoints across which regulatory signals are rewired paralleling changes in cellular state. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of human B lymphopoiesis, laying a foundation to apply this approach to other tissues and ``corrupted'' developmental processes including cancer.},

Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. Results: We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method's utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq datasets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique.

Dendritic cells (DCs) are important components of the immune system that form from the bone marrow into two major cell lineages: plasmacytoid DCs and conventional DCs. See et al. applied single-cell RNA sequencing and cytometry by time-of-flight to characterize the developmental pathways of these cells. They identified blood DC precursors that shared surface markers with plasmacytoid DCs but that were functionally distinct. This unsuspected level of complexity in pre-DC populations reveals additional cell types and refines understanding of known cell types.
Science, this issue p. eaag3009
Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONDendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells that orchestrate immune responses. The human DC population comprises multiple subsets, including plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and two functionally specialized lineages of conventional DC (cDC1 and cDC2), whose origins and differentiation pathways remain incompletely defined.
RATIONALEAs DC are essential regulators of the immune response in health and disease, potential intervention strategies aiming at manipulation of these cells will require in-depth insights of their origins, the mechanisms that govern their homeostasis, and their functional properties. Here, we employed two unbiased high-dimensional technologies to characterize the human DC lineage from bone marrow to blood.
RESULTSWe isolated the DC-containing population (Lineage-HLA-DR+CD135+ cells) from human blood and defined the transcriptomes of 710 individual cells using massively parallel single-cell mRNA sequencing. By combining complementary bioinformatic approaches, we identified a small cluster of cells within this population as putative DC precursors (pre-DC). We then confirmed this finding using cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to simultaneously measure the expression of a panel of 38 different proteins at the single-cell level on Lineage-HLA-DR+ cells and found that pre-DC possessed a CD123+CD33+CD45RA+ phenotype. We confirmed the precursor potential of pre-DC by establishing their potential to differentiate in vitro into cDC1 and cDC2, but not pDC, in the known proportions found in vivo.Interestingly, pre-DC also express classical pDC markers, including CD123, CD303, and CD304. Thus, any previous studies using these markers to identify or isolate pDC will have inadvertently included CD123+CD33+ pre-DC. We provide here new markers that can be used to identify unambiguously pre-DC from pDC, including CD33, CX3CR1, CD2, CD5, and CD327. When CD123+CD33+ pre-DC and CD123+CD33- pDC were isolated separately, we observed that pre-DC have unique functional properties that were previously attributed to pDC. Although pDC remain bona fide interferon-$\alpha$\textendash{}producing cells, their reported interleukin-12 (IL-12) production and CD4 T cell allostimulatory capacity can likely be attributed to ``contaminating'' pre-DC.We then asked whether the pre-DC population contained both uncommitted and committed pre-cDC1 and pre-cDC2 precursors, as recently shown in mice. Using microfluidic single-cell mRNA sequencing (scmRNAseq), we showed that the human pre-DC population contains cells exhibiting transcriptomic priming toward cDC1 and cDC2 lineages. Flow cytometry and in vitro DC differentiation experiments further identified CD123+CADM1-CD1c- putative uncommitted pre-DC, alongside CADM1+CD1c- pre-cDC1 and CADM1-CD1c+ pre-cDC2. Finally, we found that pre-DC subsets expressed T cell costimulatory molecules and induced comparable proliferation and polarization of na{\"\i}ve CD4 T cells as adult DC. However, exposure to the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) ligand CpG triggered IL-12p40 and tumor necrosis factor\textendash$\alpha$ production by early pre-DC, pre-cDC1, and pre-cDC2, in contrast to differentiated cDC1 and cDC2, which do not express TLR9.
CONCLUSIONUsing unsupervised scmRNAseq and CyTOF analyses, we have unraveled the complexity of the human DC lineage at the single-cell level, revealing a continuous process of differentiation that starts in the bone marrow (BM) with common DC progenitors (CDP), diverges at the point of emergence of pre-DC and pDC potential, and culminates in maturation of both lineages in the blood and spleen. The pre-DC compartment contains functionally and phenotypically distinct lineage-committed subpopulations, including one early uncommitted CD123+ pre-DC subset and two CD45RA+CD123lo lineage-committed subsets. The discovery of multiple committed pre-DC populations with unique capabilities opens promising new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of DC subset-specific targeting. $<$img class="fragment-image" src="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/356/6342/eaag3009/F1.medium.gif"/$>$ Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Human DC emerge from BM CDP, diverge at the point of emergence of pre-DC and pDC potential, and culminate in maturation of both lineages in the blood.The pre-DC compartment further differentiates into functionally and phenotypically distinct lineage-committed subpopulations, including one early uncommitted CD123+ pre-DC subset (early pre-DC), which give rise to both cDC1 and cDC2 through corresponding CD45RA+CD123lo pre-cDC1 and pre-cDC2 lineage-committed subsets, respectively.
Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells that orchestrate immune responses. The human DC population comprises two main functionally specialized lineages, whose origins and differentiation pathways remain incompletely defined. Here, we combine two high-dimensional technologies\textemdash{}single-cell messenger RNA sequencing (scmRNAseq) and cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF)\textemdash{}to identify human blood CD123+CD33+CD45RA+ DC precursors (pre-DC). Pre-DC share surface markers with plasmacytoid DC (pDC) but have distinct functional properties that were previously attributed to pDC. Tracing the differentiation of DC from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood revealed that the pre-DC compartment contains distinct lineage-committed subpopulations, including one early uncommitted CD123high pre-DC subset and two CD45RA+CD123low lineage-committed subsets exhibiting functional differences. The discovery of multiple committed pre-DC populations opens promising new avenues for the therapeutic exploitation of DC subset-specific targeting.
In human blood, the immunological dendritic cell lineage contains many predendritic cell populations.

Where and when commitment to the cDC1 or cDC2 lineage occurs remains poorly understood. Here we found that transcriptional signatures of the cDC1 and cDC2 lineages became evident at the single-cell level from the CDP stage. We also identified Siglec-H and Ly6C as lineage markers that distinguished pre-DC subpopulations committed to the cDC1 lineage (Siglec-H-Ly6C- pre-DCs) or cDC2 lineage (Siglec-H-Ly6C+ pre-DCs). Our results indicate that commitment to the cDC1 or cDC2 lineage occurs in the BM and not in the periphery.},

Promising new methods have emerged for reconstructing a progression 'trajectory' from static single-cell transcriptome measurements. However, it remains unclear how to adequately model the appreciable level of noise in these data to elucidate gene regulatory network rewiring. Here, we present a framework called Single Cell Inference of MorphIng Trajectories and their Associated Regulation (SCIMITAR) that infers progressions from static single-cell transcriptomes by employing a continuous parametrization of Gaussian mixtures in high-dimensional curves. SCIMITAR yields rich models from the data that highlight genes with expression and co-expression patterns that are associated with the inferred progression. Further, SCIMITAR extracts regulatory states from the implicated trajectory-evolvingco-expression networks. We benchmark the method on simulated data to show that it yields accurate cell ordering and gene network inferences. Applied to the interpretation of a single-cell human fetal neuron dataset, SCIMITAR finds progression-associated genes in cornerstone neural differentiation pathways missed by standard differential expression tests. Finally, by leveraging the rewiring of gene-gene co-expression relations across the progression, the method reveals the rise and fall of co-regulatory states and trajectory-dependent gene modules. These analyses implicate new transcription factors in neural differentiation including putative co-factors for the multi-functional NFAT pathway.},

Here, we introduce HopLand, a pseudotime recovery method using continuous Hopfield network to map cells to a Waddington's epigenetic landscape. It reveals from the single-cell data the combinatorial regulatory interactions among genes that control the dynamic progression through successive cell states. Results: We applied HopLand to different types of single-cell transcriptomic data. It achieved high accuracies of pseudotime prediction compared with existing methods. Moreover, a kinetic model can be extracted from each dataset. Through the analysis of such a model, we identified key genes and regulatory interactions driving the transition of cell states. Therefore, our method has the potential to generate fundamental insights into cell fate regulation.Availability and implementation: The MATLAB implementation of HopLand is available at https://github.com/NetLand-NTU/HopLand.Contact:zhengjie@ntu.edu.sg},

Several methods have been proposed for such inference from high-dimensional single-cell data. They typically assign each cell to a branch in a differentiation trajectory. However, they commonly assume specific geometries such as tree-like developmental hierarchies and lack statistically sound methods to decide on the number of branching events.ResultsWe present K-Branches, a solution to the above problem by locally fitting half-lines to single-cell data, introducing a clustering algorithm similar to K-Means. These halflines are proxies for branches in the differentiation trajectory of cells. We propose a modified version of the GAP statistic for model selection, in order to decide on the number of lines that best describe the data locally. In this manner, we identify the location and number of subgroups of cells that are associated with branching events and full differentiation, respectively. We evaluate the performance of our method on single-cell RNA-Seq data describing the differentiation of myeloid progenitors during hematopoiesis, single-cell qPCR data of mouse blastocyst development, single-cell qPCR data of human myeloid monocytic leukemia and artificial data.Availability and implementationAn R implementation of K-Branches is freely available at https://github.com/theislab/kbranches.Contactfabian.theis@helmholtz-muenchen.deSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Signalling entropy identifies known cell subpopulations of varying potency and drug resistant cancer stem-cell phenotypes, including those derived from circulating tumour cells. It further reveals that expression heterogeneity within single-cell populations is regulated.

However, the analysis of time series single cell RNA-Seq data raises several new computational challenges. Cells at each time point are often sampled from a mixture of cell types, each of which may be a progenitor of one, or several, specific fates making it hard to determine which cells should be used to reconstruct temporal trajectories. In addition, cells, even from the same time point, may be unsynchronized making it hard to rely on the measured time for determining these trajectories.ResultsWe present TASIC a new method for determining temporal trajectories, branching and cell assignments in single cell time series experiments. Unlike prior approaches TASIC uses on a probabilistic graphical model to integrate expression and time information making it more robust to noise and stochastic variations. Applying TASIC to in vitro myoblast differentiation and in-vivo lung development data we show that it accurately reconstructs developmental trajectories from single cell experiments. The reconstructed models enabled us to identify key genes involved in cell fate determination and to obtain new insights about a specific type of lung cells and its role in development.Availability and ImplementationThe TASIC software package is posted in the supporting website.

  abstract = {Single-cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. Because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. However, some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single-cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, population balance analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high-dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.},

  abstract = {Sequencing the transcriptomes of single cells has greatly advanced our understanding of the cellular composition of complex tissues. In many of these systems, the role of heterogeneity has risen to prominence as a determinant of cell type composition and lineage transitions. While much effort has gone into developing appropriate tools for the analysis and comprehension of single cell sequencing data, further advances are required. Optimization-based approaches are under-utilized in single cell analysis and hold much potential due to their ability to capture global properties of the system in low dimension. Here we present SoptSC: an optimization-based algorithm for the identification of subpopulation structure, transition paths, and pseudotemporal ordering within a cell population. Based on a measure of similarity between cells, SoptSC uses non-negative matrix factorization to create low dimensional representations of the data for analysis and visualization. We find that in several examples, the low-dimensional representations produced by SoptSC offer greater potential for insight than alternative methods. We tested our methods on a simulated dataset and four published single cell datasets from Homo sapiens and Mus musculus. SoptSC is able to recapitulate a simulated developmental trajectory with greater fidelity than com- parable methods. Applied to two datasets on early embryonic development, SoptSC recapitulates known trajectories with high accuracy. Analysis of murine epidermis reveals overall agreement with previous studies, but differs markedly regarding the composition and heterogeneity of the basal compartment. Analysis of murine myelopoiesis found that SoptSC can resolve complex hematopoietic subpopulation composition, and led to a new prediction regarding the asynchronous development of myeloid subpopulations during stem cell differentiation.},

Modern single-cell technologies allow multiplexed sampling of cellular states within a tissue. However, computational tools that can infer developmental cell-state transitions reproducibly from such single-cell data are lacking. Here, we introduce p-Creode, an unsupervised algorithm that produces multi-branching graphs from single-cell data, compares graphs with differing topologies, and infers a statistically robust hierarchy of cell-state transitions that define developmental trajectories. We have applied p-Creode to mass cytometry, multiplex immunofluorescence, and single-cell RNA-seq data. As a test case, we validate cell-state-transition trajectories predicted by p-Creode for intestinal tuft cells, a rare, chemosensory cell type. We clarify that tuft cells are specified outside of the \emph{Atoh1}-dependent secretory lineage in the small intestine. However, p-Creode also predicts, and we confirm, that tuft cells arise from an alternative, \emph{Atoh1}-driven developmental program in the colon. These studies introduce p-Creode as a reliable method for analyzing large datasets that depict branching transition trajectories.$<$/p$>$

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq allows quantification of biological heterogeneity across both discrete cell types and continuous cell differentiation transitions. We present approximate graph abstraction (AGA), an algorithm that reconciles the computational analysis strategies of clustering and trajectory inference by explaining cell-to-cell variation both in terms of discrete and continuous latent variables (https://github.com/theislab/graph\_abstraction). This enables to generate cellular maps of differentiation manifolds with complex topologies --- efficiently and robustly across different datasets. Approximate graph abstraction quantifies the connectivity of partitions of a neighborhood graph of single cells, thereby generating a much simpler abstracted graph whose nodes label the partitions. Together with a random walk-based distance measure, this generates a topology preserving map of single cells --- a partial coordinatization of data useful for exploring and explaining its variation. We use the abstracted graph to assess which subsets of data are better explained by discrete clusters than by a continuous variable, to trace gene expression changes along aggregated single-cell paths through data and to infer abstracted trees that best explain the global topology of data. We demonstrate the power of the method by reconstructing differentiation processes with high numbers of branchings from single-cell gene expression datasets and by identifying biological trajectories from single-cell imaging data using a deep-learning based distance metric. Along with the method, we introduce measures for the connectivity of graph partitions, generalize random-walk based distance measures to disconnected graphs and introduce a path-based measure for topological similarity between graphs. Graph abstraction is computationally efficient and provides speedups of at least 30 times when compared to algorithms for the inference of lineage trees.},

However current implementations are computationally intensive and will not scale up to modern droplet-based single-cell datasets which routinely profile many tens of thousands of cells. We provide an efficient implementation which allows scaling up this approach to modern single-cell datasets. We also generalize the application of pseudotime inference to cases where there are other sources of variation, such as branching dynamics. We applied our method on microarray, nCounter, RNA-seq, qPCR and droplet-based datasets from different organisms. The model converges an order of magnitude faster compared to existing methods whilst achieving similar levels of estimation accuracy. Further, we demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by extending the model to higher-dimensional latent spaces that can be used to simultaneously infer pseudotime and other structure such as branching. Thus, the model has the capability of producing meaningful biological insights about cell ordering as well as cell fate regulation. Software available at github.com/ManchesterBioinference/GrandPrix},

Advances have been made in uncovering gene expression heterogeneity, discovering new cell types and novel identification of genes and transcription factors involved in cellular processes. One such approach to the analysis is to construct pseudotime orderings of cells as they progress through a particular biological process, such as cell-cycle or differentiation. These methods assign a score - known as the pseudotime - to each cell as a surrogate measure of progression. However, all published methods to date are purely algorithmic and lack any way to give uncertainty to the pseudotime assigned to a cell. Here we present a method that combines Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models (GP-LVM) with a recently published electroGP prior to perform Bayesian inference on the pseudotimes.

Applying this method to primary human myoblasts, we not only identified three known cell types but also estimated both their fate probabilities and transition probabilities among them. We found that the percent of the genes expressed in a bursty manner is significantly higher at the branch point than before or after branch, and there are apparent changes in both gene-gene and cell-cell correlations before and after branch. In general, single-cell transcriptome data with Topographer can well reveal the stochastic mechanisms of cell fate decisions from three different levels: cell lineage (macroscopic), gene network (mesoscopic) and gene expression (microscopic).},

Results: Here we present scEpath, an algorithm that calculates energy landscapes and probabilistic directed graphs in order to reconstruct developmental trajectories. We quantify the energy landscape using "single-cell energy" and distance-based measures, and find that the combination of these enables robust inference of the transition probabilities and lineage relationships between cell states. We also identify marker genes and gene expression patterns associated with cell state transitions. Our approach produces pseudotemporal orderings that are - in combination - more robust and accurate than current methods, and offers higher resolution dynamics of the cell state transitions, leading to new insight into key transition events during differentiation and development. Moreover, scEpath is robust to variation in the size of the input gene set, and is broadly unsupervised, requiring few parameters to be set by the user. Applications of scEpath led to the identification of a cell-cell communication network implicated in early human embryo development, and novel transcription factors important for myoblast differentiation. scEpath allows us to identify common and specific temporal dynamics and transcriptional factor programs along branched lineages, as well as the transition probabilities that control cell fates.

Here, we present Finding Orderings Robustly using k-means and Steiner trees (FORKS), an algorithm that pseudo-temporally orders cells and thereby infers bifurcating state trajectories. FORKS, which is a generic method, can be applied to both single-cell and bulk differentiation data. It is a semi-supervised approach, in that it requires the user to specify the starting point of the time course. We systematically benchmarked FORKS and eight other pseudo-time estimation algorithms on six benchmark datasets, and found it to be more accurate, more reproducible, and more memory-efficient than existing methods for pseudo-temporal ordering. Another major advantage of our approach is its robustness - FORKS can be used with default parameter settings on a wide range of datasets.},

  abstract = {Measurement of gene expression levels for multiple genes in single cells provides a powerful approach to study heterogeneity of cell populations and cellular plasticity. While the expression levels of multiple genes in each cell are available in such data, the potential connections among the cells (e.g. the cellular state transition relationship) are not directly evident from the measurement. Classifying the cellular states, identifying their transitions among those states, and extracting the pseudotime ordering of cells are challenging due to the noise in the data and the high-dimensionality in the number of genes in the data. In this paper we adapt the classical self-organizing-map (SOM) approach for single-cell gene expression data (SOMSC), such as those based on single cell qPCR and single cell RNA-seq. In SOMSC, a cellular state map (CSM) is derived and employed to identify cellular states inherited in the population of the measured single cells. Cells located in the same basin of the CSM are considered as in one cellular state while barriers among the basins in CSM provide information on transitions among the cellular states. A cellular state transitions path (e.g. differentiation) and a temporal ordering of the measured single cells are consequently obtained. In addition, SOMSC could estimate the cellular state replication probability and transition probabilities. Applied to a set of synthetic data, one single-cell qPCR data set on mouse early embryonic development and two single-cell RNA-seq data sets, SOMSC shows effectiveness in capturing cellular states and their transitions presented in the high-dimensional single-cell data. This approach will have broader applications to analyzing cellular fate specification and cell lineages using single cell gene expression data.},

  abstract = {In the era of 'Big Data' there is a pressing need for tools that provide human interpretable visualizations of emergent patterns in high-throughput high-dimensional data. Further, to enable insightful data exploration, such visualizations should faithfully capture and emphasize emergent structures and patterns without enforcing prior assumptions on the shape or form of the data. In this paper, we present PHATE (Potential of Heat-diffusion for Affinity-based Transition Embedding) - an unsupervised low-dimensional embedding for visualization of data that is aimed at solving these issues. Unlike previous methods that are commonly used for visualization, such as PCA and tSNE, PHATE is able to capture and highlight both local and global structure in the data. In particular, in addition to clustering patterns, PHATE also uncovers and emphasizes progression and transitions (when they exist) in the data, which are often missed in other visualization-capable methods. Such patterns are especially important in biological data that contain, for example, single-cell phenotypes at different phases of differentiation, patients at different stages of disease progression, and gut microbial compositions that vary gradually between individuals, even of the same enterotype. The embedding provided by PHATE is based on a novel informational distance that captures long-range nonlinear relations in the data by computing energy potentials of data-adaptive diffusion processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the produced visualization in revealing insights on a wide variety of biomedical data, including single-cell RNA-sequencing, mass cytometry, gut microbiome sequencing, human SNP data, Hi-C data, as well as non-biomedical data, such as facebook network and facial image data. In order to validate the capability of PHATE to enable exploratory analysis, we generate a new dataset of 31,000 single-cells from a human embryoid body differentiation system. Here, PHATE provides a comprehensive picture of the differentiation process, while visualizing major and minor branching trajectories in the data. We validate that all known cell types are recapitulated in the PHATE embedding in proper organization. Furthermore, the global picture of the system offered by PHATE allows us to connect parts of the developmental progression and characterize novel regulators associated with developmental lineages.},

  abstract = {During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of cell fate decisions to form a complete organism, epitomising a branching process. In some instances, these decisions are reversible, particularly during the onset of disease, exemplifying a recombination process. Single cell transcriptomics provides a rich resource to explore the temporal progression of bifurcations in gene activity, useful to elucidate the mechanisms of cell fate decisions. However, identification of transcriptional branching or recombination poses a major statistical challenge. Here, we have developed a comprehensive nonparametric Bayesian approach to the inference of branching and recombination, in the form of branch-recombinant Gaussian Processes (B-RGPs). We use B-RGPs to infer transcriptional branching that occurs during early human development as primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of sperm and egg, are specified in the developing embryo. Using our approach, we identify known master regulators of human PGC development, and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways, as well as transcription factors and epigenetic modifiers. By concentrating on the earliest branched signalling events, we identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate. Indeed, the experimental validation of our prediction confirmed that pharmacological blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK) enhanced the competency for PGC fate in vitro. Thus, B-RGPs represent a powerful and flexible data-driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early embryogenesis.},

We consider several criteria for building good benchmarks and the advantages to be gained when they are used intelligently. To illustrate these principles, we present a more detailed discussion of benchmarks for multiple alignments of protein sequences. As in many other domains, significant progress has been achieved in the multiple alignment field and the datasets have become progressively more challenging as the existing algorithms have evolved.

So far, however, a systematic critical study concerning the various sources underlying this over-optimism is lacking.Results: We present an empirical study on over-optimism using high-dimensional classification as example. Specifically, we consider a `promising' new classification algorithm, namely linear discriminant analysis incorporating prior knowledge on gene functional groups through an appropriate shrinkage of the within-group covariance matrix. While this approach yields poor results in terms of error rate, we quantitatively demonstrate that it can artificially seem superior to existing approaches if we `fish for significance'. The investigated sources of over-optimism include the optimization of datasets, of settings, of competing methods and, most importantly, of the method's characteristics. We conclude that, if the improvement of a quantitative criterion such as the error rate is the main contribution of a paper, the superiority of new algorithms should always be demonstrated on independent validation data.Availability: The R codes and relevant data can be downloaded from http://www.ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de/organisation/mitarbeiter/020\_professuren/boulesteix/overoptimism/, such that the study is completely reproducible.Contact:boulesteix@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de},

Computational systems biology seems to be caught in what we call the `self-assessment trap', in which researchers wishing to publish their analytical methods are required by referees or by editorial policy (e.g., Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics, Nucleic Acids Research) to compare the performance of their own algorithms against other methodologies, thus being forced to be judge, jury and executioner. The result is that the authors' method tends to be the best in an unreasonable majority of cases (Table I). In many instances, this bias is the result of selective reporting of performance in the niche in which the method is superior. Evidence of that is that most papers reporting best performance choose only one or two metrics of performance, but when the number of performance metrics is larger than two, most methods fail to be the best in all categories assessed (Table I). Choosing many metrics can dramatically change the determination of best performance (Supplementary Table S1). Selective reporting can be inadvertent, but in some cases biases are more disingenuous, involving hiding information or quietly cutting corners in the performance evaluation (similar problems have been discussed in assessments of the performance of supercomputers, e.g., Bailey (1991)).

View this table:

Manifold learning provides a powerful structure for algorithmic approaches to process the data, extract its dynamics, and infer patterns in it.

  abstract = {Using single-cell -omics data, it is now possible to computationally order cells along trajectories, allowing the unbiased study of cellular dynamic processes. Since 2014, more than 50 trajectory inference methods have been developed, each with its own set of methodological characteristics. As a result, choosing a method to infer trajectories is often challenging, since a comprehensive assessment of the performance and robustness of each method is still lacking. In order to facilitate the comparison of the results of these methods to each other and to a gold standard, we developed a global framework to benchmark trajectory inference tools. Using this framework, we compared the trajectories from a total of 29 trajectory inference methods, on a large collection of real and synthetic datasets. We evaluate methods using several metrics, including accuracy of the inferred ordering, correctness of the network topology, code quality and user friendliness. We found that some methods, including Slingshot, TSCAN and Monocle DDRTree, clearly outperform other methods, although their performance depended on the type of trajectory present in the data. Based on our benchmarking results, we therefore developed a set of guidelines for method users. However, our analysis also indicated that there is still a lot of room for improvement, especially for methods detecting complex trajectory topologies. Our evaluation pipeline can therefore be used to spearhead the development of new scalable and more accurate methods, and is available at github.com/dynverse/dynverse. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive assessment of trajectory inference methods. For now, we exclusively evaluated the methods on their default parameters, but plan to add a detailed parameter tuning procedure in the future. We gladly welcome any discussion and feedback on key decisions made as part of this study, including the metrics used in the benchmark, the quality control checklist, and the implementation of the method wrappers.
