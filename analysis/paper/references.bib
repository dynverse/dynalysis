  abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq allows quantification of biological heterogeneity across both discrete cell types and continuous cell differentiation transitions. We present approximate graph abstraction (AGA), an algorithm that reconciles the computational analysis strategies of clustering and trajectory inference by explaining cell-to-cell variation both in terms of discrete and continuous latent variables (https://github.com/theislab/graph\_abstraction). This enables to generate cellular maps of differentiation manifolds with complex topologies --- efficiently and robustly across different datasets. Approximate graph abstraction quantifies the connectivity of partitions of a neighborhood graph of single cells, thereby generating a much simpler abstracted graph whose nodes label the partitions. Together with a random walk-based distance measure, this generates a topology preserving map of single cells --- a partial coordinatization of data useful for exploring and explaining its variation. We use the abstracted graph to assess which subsets of data are better explained by discrete clusters than by a continuous variable, to trace gene expression changes along aggregated single-cell paths through data and to infer abstracted trees that best explain the global topology of data. We demonstrate the power of the method by reconstructing differentiation processes with high numbers of branchings from single-cell gene expression datasets and by identifying biological trajectories from single-cell imaging data using a deep-learning based distance metric. Along with the method, we introduce measures for the connectivity of graph partitions, generalize random-walk based distance measures to disconnected graphs and introduce a path-based measure for topological similarity between graphs. Graph abstraction is computationally efficient and provides speedups of at least 30 times when compared to algorithms for the inference of lineage trees.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing gene regulatory networks from high-throughput data is a long-standing problem. Through the DREAM project (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods), we performed a comprehensive blind assessment of over thirty network inference methods on Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in silico microarray data. We characterize performance, data requirements, and inherent biases of different inference approaches offering guidelines for both algorithm application and development. We observe that no single inference method performs optimally across all datasets. In contrast, integration of predictions from multiple inference methods shows robust and high performance across diverse datasets. Thereby, we construct high-confidence networks for E. coli and S. aureus, each comprising \textasciitilde{}1700 transcriptional interactions at an estimated precision of 50\%. We experimentally test 53 novel interactions in E. coli, of which 23 were supported (43\%). Our results establish community-based methods as a powerful and robust tool for the inference of transcriptional gene regulatory networks.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in single-cell transcriptomics have opened new opportunities for studying dynamic processes in immunology in a high throughput and unbiased manner. Starting from a mixture of cells in different stages of a developmental process, unsupervised trajectory inference algorithms aim to automatically reconstruct the underlying developmental path that cells are following. In this review, we break down the strategies used by this novel class of methods, and organize their components into a common framework, highlighting several practical advantages and disadvantages of the individual methods. We also give an overview of new insights these methods have already provided regarding the wiring and gene regulation of cell differentiation. As the trajectory inference field is still in its infancy, we propose several future developments that will ultimately lead to a global and data-driven way of studying immune cell differentiation.},

However, nonlinear gene expression changes, genes unrelated to the process, and the possibility of branching trajectories make this a challenging problem. We develop SLICER (Selective Locally Linear Inference of Cellular Expression Relationships) to address these challenges. SLICER can infer highly nonlinear trajectories, select genes without prior knowledge of the process, and automatically determine the location and number of branches and loops. SLICER recovers the ordering of points along simulated trajectories more accurately than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SLICER on previously published data from mouse lung cells and neural stem cells.},
