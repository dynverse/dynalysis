\usage{
qsub_pmap(.x, .f, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{.x}{Vectors of the same length. A vector of length 1 will
be recycled.}

\item{.f}{A function, formula, or atomic vector.

If a \strong{function}, it is used as is.

If a \strong{formula}, e.g. \code{~ .x + 2}, it is converted to a function. There
are three ways to refer to the arguments:
\itemize{
\item For a single argument function, use \code{.}
\item For a two argument function, use \code{.x} and \code{.y}
\item For more arguments, use \code{..1}, \code{..2}, \code{..3} etc
}

This syntax allows you to create very compact anonymous functions.

If \strong{character vector}, \strong{numeric vector}, or \strong{list}, it
is converted to an extractor function. Character vectors index by name
and numeric vectors index by position; use a list to index by position
and name at different levels. Within a list, wrap strings in \code{\link[=get-attr]{get-attr()}}
to extract named attributes. If a component is not present, the value of
\code{.default} will be returned.}

\item{...}{Params given to \code{\link[qsub:qsub_lapply]{qsub::qsub_lapply()}}}
}
