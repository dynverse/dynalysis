\title{A benchmark suite with which to run all the methods on the different datasets}
\usage{
benchmark_submit(design, timeout_per_execution = 3600,
  max_memory_per_execution = "10G", metrics = "correlation",
  local_output_folder, remote_output_folder, execute_before = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{Design tibble of the experiment:
- A tibble containing columns `dataset_ids`, `method_id`, `parameters`, `give_priors` and `repeat_ix`
- A tibble generated by [generate_benchmark_design()]}

\item{timeout_per_execution}{The maximum number of seconds each execution is allowed to run, otherwise it will fail.}

\item{max_memory_per_execution}{The maximum amount of memory each execution is allowed to use, otherwise it will fail.}

\item{metrics}{Which metrics to evaluate; see \code{\link{calculate_metrics}} for a list of which metrics are available.}

\item{local_output_folder}{A folder in which to output intermediate and final results.}

\item{remote_output_folder}{A folder in which to store intermediate results in a remote directory when using the qsub package.}

\item{execute_before}{Shell commands to execute before running R.}

\item{verbose}{Whether or not to print extra information.}
